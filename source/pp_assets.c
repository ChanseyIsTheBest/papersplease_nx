/* pp_assets.c -- reassemble Unity "Split Application Binary" asset files.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   Papers, Please does not ship the usual single `data.unity3d` bundle. It uses
 *   the classic non-bundled Unity layout, AND it was built with Unity's "Split
 *   Application Binary" option, so the two large serialized files arrive as
 *   1 MB chunks:
 *
 *       assets/bin/Data/globalgamemanagers.assets.split0 .. .split5   (6 parts)
 *       assets/bin/Data/sharedassets0.assets.split0      .. .split3   (4 parts)
 *
 *   On Android the engine reads those chunks straight out of the APK through a
 *   virtual filesystem (libunity carries an `AndroidSplitFile` reader for
 *   exactly this). That reader is bound to the APK/AAssetManager path, which
 *   this port does not have -- our files are loose on the SD card and reached
 *   through plain newlib file I/O.
 *
 *   Rather than try to reimplement the engine's split VFS, we simply put the
 *   files back together once, at first boot, into the names the engine expects
 *   in the ordinary non-split case: `globalgamemanagers.assets` and
 *   `sharedassets0.assets`. After that the engine takes its normal, well-trodden
 *   path and never knows anything was split.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SAFE
 *   The chunks are raw byte ranges of one logical file: split0 begins with a
 *   Unity serialized-file header and the later chunks have no header at all.
 *   That header declares the total size of the assembled file (`m_FileSize`, a
 *   big-endian int64 at offset 0x18 for format version >= 22), so the join is
 *   self-verifying: concatenate in order, compare the result against the
 *   declared size, and refuse to publish a file that does not match.
 *
 *   Verified against the shipped assets:
 *       globalgamemanagers.assets  6 parts -> 6291048 bytes, header says 6291048
 *       sharedassets0.assets       4 parts -> 3341408 bytes, header says 3341408
 *
 * COST
 *   ~9.6 MB of extra SD space and a few seconds on the very first launch only.
 *   The splits are left in place: they are small, and deleting a user's game
 *   files to save 9 MB is not a trade this code gets to make on their behalf.
 *
 * MIT, same as the rest of the tree.
